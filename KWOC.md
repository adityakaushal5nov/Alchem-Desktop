# Ideas for KWOC

### 1. Add wholesaler login: currently only the login for retailers are available, this idea would include implementing a login facility for wholesalers, since the project has to support it originally. Keep in mind all the constraints that would be needed to implement this idea. 

## 2. Refurbish UI: Since the main aim of the project was to give an amazing UX and UI, UX has been greatly improved. But UI isn't still up to the mark, with all those black spaces in the background. This would include making new designs for Home, Dashboard and tabs in "All_Features_tab" maybe using other javaFX themes (like Google's material design) and discussing them with mentor, and when coding period begins, implementing them according to proposal. Note: this would also include resolving [this issue](https://github.com/alchemsynergy/alchem/issues/15)

### 3. Object Oriented Database: Currently, Alchem uses Normalised plain old database, idea is to convert it into Object Oriented Database, there would be no need to change database API since PostgreSQL supports Object Oriented Database Design. This would include changing whole database schema, alongwith all the queries and relative parts of source code too.

### 4. Creating a payment API: Currently, the application can only log CASH payments, idea is to create an API (which would require internet to work obviously) so that payments could be made via other modes, (ex via PayTM, Paypal, etc.). Big PLUS: If same API could work for credit/debit card payments, that would be really good.
